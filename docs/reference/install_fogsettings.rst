The .fogsettings file
---------------------

The low-level settings that are used during installation and some settings that simply cannot be stored in the database are contained in the /opt/fog/.fogsettings file.

This file contains the setup of variables used within the installer during upgrades and installs.

Header
""""""

Only gives some simplistic information to help users.
Does no actions just gives some information.
::

  ## Start of FOG Settings
  ## Created by the FOG Installer
  ## Version: 7625
  ## Install time: Sat 14 May 2016 08:05:18 PM EDT

Footer
""""""

Does no actions, just tells where FOG's default variables are setup
Any new items will go below this, and you can add your own variables.
You can add variables wherever you want.
::

  ## End of FOG Settings

IP Address
""""""""""

Defines the IP address of the node/server.
This is also used on servers to setup the default.ipxe file.
::

  ipaddress='192.168.1.5'

Interface
"""""""""

This just sets the storage nodes/server interface as it will be stored in the Database.  This used to be used for multicast setups and for the bandwidth graph.  This is now setup so it is only used on the bandwidth graph as we already know the ip address anyway.  Multicast tasks can get their own interface instead of relying on user entry.
::

  interface='eth0'

Username
""""""""

This variable is the user setup for the linux user on the server.  This allows a user to login to the server/node under this username through linux.  The purpose of this is more specifically setup for FTP usage.
::

  username='fog'

Password
""""""""

This is the linux fog user password.  It is randomly generated if the value is not already defined.  Every update will reset the password to what is in this field.  You should, if you predefined a fog user and the installation is the first time, create the /opt/fog/.fogsettings file. Only add the password field to ensure your password doesn't get changed accidentally.
::

  password='Some!random_Password\here0918358'

OS Identifier
"""""""""""""

This is the OS identifier used during the installation.  The value is numeric.

Valid Values are:
1. Redhat based.
2. Debian based.
3.  Arch
::

  osid='2'

OS Name
"""""""

This is the name of the OS as it's being installed.
::

  osname='Debian'

DNS Address
"""""""""""
Used for DHCP setup.
::

  dnsaddress='192.168.1.5'

dnsbootimage
""""""""""""
No longer used.  It's purpose was originally because the FOS (Fog Operating System -- init.xz/init_32.xz/init.gz) did not dynamically get the dns address from DHCP as dhcp was not called.
::

  dnsbootimage='192.168.1.5'

Subnet Mask
"""""""""""

This defines the subnet mask to use if the system is to be used as a DHCP server.  It will assume the subnet mask of the interface being used, but can be changed later if you see fit.
::

  submask='255.255.255.0'

Router Address
""""""""""""""

This will setup the router address to use if the system is to be used as a DHCP server.  It currently only sets as an ip address, but in the past contained the whole dhcp configuration string.  The config string was removed as it would only work on isc-dhcp-server, when some might be using dnsmasq or another dhcp server.
::

  routeraddress='192.168.1.1'

Plain Router
""""""""""""
Very similar to the Router Address elements above, but can be used to redirect to maybe another router/switch other than the main.
::
plainrouter='192.168.1.1'

dodhcp
""""""

Just tells if we want fog to install dhcp.
::

  dodhcp='N'

bldhcp
""""""
Same, more or less, as dodhcp
::

  bldhcp='0'

dhcpd
"""""
Defines what package to install for dhcp server.
::

  dhcpd='isc-dhcp-server'

startrange
""""""""""
::
  startrange=''

endrange
""""""""
::

  endrange=''

bootfilename
""""""""""""
::

  bootfilename='undionly.kpxe'

NFS
"""
Defines if the installer should rebuild the exports every time. Setting to 0 will ensure the exports file for nfs does not get rebuilt. Setting to 1 will update the exports file.
::

  blexports='1'

Type of installation
""""""""""""""""""""
Just tells the installer if this is going to be a full server, or a node.  If it's a node, the value will be S.  If it's a full server, the value will be N.
::

  installtype='N'

MySQL User
""""""""""
This is the username to connect to the database as.  Blank will default to connecting as user root.
::

  snmysqluser=''

MySQL Password
This is the password to connect to the database.
::

  snmysqlpass=''

MySQL Host
""""""""""
This is the host to connect to the database.  Blank will default to localhost/127.0.0.1.
::

  snmysqlhost=''

Language
""""""""
Language packs for the OS can be installed.  This enables more appropriate translations of information.
::

   installlang='0'

Donate
""""""
Donate seems a bit strange a name for this.  What it does, however, is not pass money.  It's a different method that tells the server if it's going to allow mining of bitcoins during the imaging phases. Donation can be disabled later and this value will have no more effect during updates. It only operates to define setting during fresh installs.
::

  donate='0'

Image storage
"""""""""""""
This defines the location for image storage. This is just a string value to the path of your images location.
::

  storageLocation='/images'


Updating
""""""""
This defines if the update file is loaded. 1 is the set value after fresh install.  When the .fogsettings file is loaded this value is checked and tells the system to perform an update. If this isn't 1 or the variable is not found, it requests "input" from the user (unless you're running with the -y argument).
::

  fogupdateloaded=1

docroot
"""""""

This value tells httpd where the document root will be for the GUI.
For example, when you go to http://127.0.0.1/  The document root is looking on the server at the docroot location for files to present to the user.
::

  docroot='/var/www/html/'

webroot
"""""""
This value tells FOG where the webroot is.  Webroot is the link to actually get to the FOG GUI. If the value is just '/' you would be accessing the FOG GUI with the link http://127.0.0.1/.  If it's 'fog/' you are accessing the GUI as http://127.0.0.1/fog/.
::

  webroot='fog/'


caCreated
"""""""""
::

  caCreated='yes'

packages
""""""""
Lists all packages that need to be installed

Debian 9 example as of August 1st, 2018. This requires the Remi repository to be installed (which the fog installer sets up for you).
::

  packages='apache2 bc build-essential cpp curl g++ gawk gcc genisoimage gzip htmldoc isolinux lftp libapache2-mod-php7.0 libc6 libcurl3 liblzma-dev m4 mysql-client mysql-server net-tools nfs-kernel-server openssh-server php7.0 php7.0-bcmath php7.0-cli php7.0-curl php7.0-fpm php7.0-gd php7.0-json php7.0-mbstring php7.0-mcrypt php7.0-mysql php7.0-mysqlnd php-gettext sysv-rc-conf tar tftpd-hpa tftp-hpa unzip vsftpd wget xinetd zlib1g'


CentOS 7 example as of August 1st, 2018. These packages require the epel repository (which the fog installer sets up for you).
::

::

  notpxedefaultfile=''

::

  sslpath='/opt/fog/snapins/ssl/'
